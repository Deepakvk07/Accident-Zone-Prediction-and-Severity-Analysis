🚦 Accident Zone Prediction and Severity Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify high-risk accident zones and predict accident severity. The aim is to use data mining and predictive modeling techniques to provide actionable insights that can improve road safety and help authorities make data-driven decisions.

🧩 Project Overview
The workflow involves:
Loading and preparing accident data from Excel.
Categorizing accident types to better understand contributing factors.
Aggregating data to identify regions with the highest number of accidents and casualties.
Predicting accident severity using machine learning models.
Forecasting future accident trends to assist in planning and prevention.


🔧 Tools & Technologies
IBM SPSS Modeler (or similar visual data mining tool)
Excel (for importing accident datasets)
Machine Learning (for prediction and forecasting)
Data Aggregation & Transformation Nodes
Visualization Components (charts, tables)

🗂 Workflow Description
📥 1. Data Input
Reads accident data from an Excel file named accident_prediction_....

The data is previewed using a Table node for validation.

📊 2. Accident Type Classification
Accident types are categorized for clearer analysis and grouping.

📌 3. Aggregation for High-Risk Zones
Data is aggregated based on location or type to find areas with high casualty numbers.

Used to identify high-risk zones.

📈 4. Visualization
Key metrics like Number of Casualties are plotted.

Tabular outputs help summarize zone-based statistics.

🔮 5. Predictive Modeling
A model named AccidentSeverity is trained using features like accident type.

This model is used to forecast accident severity and visualize its future trends.
